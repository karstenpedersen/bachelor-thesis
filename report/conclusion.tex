\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, we have found CTF challenges to be a practical and exciting way to encourage exploration within computer science and cybersecurity topics. We have successfully developed and verified five different CTF challenges. Each challenge is designed to test players in diverse topics from computer science, such as cross-site scripting, artificial intelligence, phishing, binary exploitation, and open-source intelligence. We have learned to design and develop CTF challenges and use systems like Docker and NGINX to configure services effectively.
If the challenges were to be hosted on the CTF platform in the future, we would need to look into hardening them further. If they eventually get hosted on the platform, we could gather feedback on them to see how intuitive and approachable they are for other people.
