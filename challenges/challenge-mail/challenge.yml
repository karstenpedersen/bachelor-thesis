    You need to create and send a phishing email to an employee inside Meridian Corp. Their home page is at company.$DOMAIN. You have been given a screenshot of the email to recreate, and it should include an a-tag with a href that the employee can send a POST request too. The employee will look at it in 600x215 resolution. You can send emails to mailserver:1025 from $DOMAIN:8022, access using SSH with the username: gl and password: hf. You can access mail.$DOMAIN to see how the mails you send look. It might be a good idea to make the email seem urgent by putting urgent keywords in the its subject.

    Go to company.$DOMAIN:8080 and find the least tech-savvy employee.
    SSH into $DOMAIN:8022 and start a HTTP server that accepts POST requests.

    Send the email from the SSH server using mhsendmail at mailserver:1025.
