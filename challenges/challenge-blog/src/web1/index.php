    <h1>My Summer Travels - 2024</h1>


    <div>
        <h3>An Experience</h3>
        <p>Time to return and prepare for exams. Hopefully none of my students tried anything sneaky while I was away!
        </p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Airports and Anonymity</h3>
        <p>I always find airports strange. You're surrounded by thousands of people, yet feel completely anonymous.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>River Boats</h3>
        <p>The peaceful flow of the river made for a perfect afternoon cruise.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Street Food Heaven</h3>
        <p>I stumbled upon a tiny alley packed with food stalls. The ramen here is unbeatable.</p>

    </div>


    <div>
        <h3>Currency Confusion</h3>
        <p>I accidentally tipped someone using Kroners. They were very polite about it, but I'm pretty sure I got
            sideeyed.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Twisting Alleys</h3>
        <p>These winding roads have their own kind of charm. It's easy to get lost—in a good way.</p>
        <img src="/pictures/p9.jpg" alt="Narrow Alley" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>A Geoguessr Dream</h3>
        <p>This spot would be a dream for GeoGuessr players. So many telltale signs.</p>
        <img src="/pictures/p8.jpg" alt="Iconic Japanese Streets" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>A Quiet Retreat</h3>
        <p>Sometimes the simplest gates lead to the most peaceful spots.</p>
        <img src="/pictures/p7.jpg" alt="A Beatiful Entry" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Local Color</h3>
        <p>The neighborhood architecture is so vibrant—especially that yellow building!</p>
        <img src="/pictures/p6.jpg" alt="Yellow House" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Urban Overload</h3>
        <p>The skyline is filled with signs and lights. It's futuristic but a bit overwhelming.</p>
        <img src="/pictures/p5.jpg" alt="Japan Photo" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>Found another peaceful body of water during my walk. The reflections were stunning.</p>
        <img src="/pictures/p4.jpg" alt="Evening Water" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Riverfront Homes</h3>
        <p>These homes have such a cozy charm by the river. I'd love to visit here again someday</p>
        <img src="/pictures/p3.jpg" alt="Cozy Buildings" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Wiring Wonders</h3>
        <p>The overhead wiring here is intense! I'm surprised it all still works...</p>
        <img src="/pictures/p2.jpg" alt="Wiring" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Sleep Deprivation</h3>
        <p>Jet lag hit me hard this time. I've been waking up at 3 AM local time, wandering empty streets with only
            vending machines for company.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Look at the traffic</h3>
        <p>These narrow roads make traffic quite the puzzle</p>
        <img src="/pictures/p1.jpg" alt="Busy Street" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>A breakaway from the rat race</h3>
        <p>Hi everyone! Thanks for stopping by. I'm taking a well-earned break before hosting the re-exams. I'll be
            updating this blog with photos as I explore. Hopefully, nobody back home tries to mess with the system while
            I'm away. I left from CPH and will return there soon enough. See you then!</p>
